  MD5C - implementation of the MD5 message-digest

    @brief Implements the MD5 message digest algorithm.

    Provides the functions needed to compute the MD5 digest of
    messages. This is a utility library and provided as a number of
    functions. It is provided for use by the PBAP library during
    authentication; performance is not adequate for processing large
    volumes of data.

    A typical application will call MD5Init, make a number of calls to
    MD5Update to supply the data, and finally call MD5Final to extract
    the data. 

    This library uses the same API as the MD5 reference implementation
    in RFC-1321, but has been optimised to reduce the code size and
    memory consumption on BlueCore.
