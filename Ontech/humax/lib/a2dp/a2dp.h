DESCRIPTION
	Header file for the A2DP profile library. The library exposes a functional 
    downstream API and an upstream message based API.

/*!
@file	a2dp.h
@brief	Interface to the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile library.		
		
		When a device wishes to start streaming audio content, the device must
		first set up a streaming connection.  During the stream setup, the
		devices select the most suitable audio streaming parameters.
		Application service capability and transport service capability are
		configured during this stream setup procedure.
		
		Once a streaming connection is established and the start streaming
		procedure is executed, audio can be streamed from the Source (SRC) 
        to the Sink (SNK).
		
		This library provides the low level services to permit an audio stream
		to be configured, started, stopped and suspended.  This library
		provides the stream configuration and control.  The actual streaming of
		data is performed by the underlying firmware.  The audio stream is
		routed to the Digital Signal Processor (DSP) present on CSR BlueCore
		Multimedia devices.  The CPU intensive operation of encoding/decoding a
		media stream is performed by the DSP.
	
		The library exposes a functional downstream API and an upstream message
		based API.
