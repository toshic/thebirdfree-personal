	derived.  See the "Bluetooth Assigned Numbers" document in the Bluetooth
	specification. The General/ Unlimited Inquiry Access Code (GIAC) is
	specified in this document as 0x9e8b33 and this is the code most
	applications will use when performing an inquiry.
	
	@param max_responses Maximum number of responses. Once this many devices
	have been discovered the inquiry process will terminate and the client task
	will be notified. Set to zero to indicate unlimited number of devices. In
	this case the inquiry will terminate when the timeout expires. It is not
	recommended that this field is set to zero or a value higher than ten as
	this may result in firmware stability issues.

	@param timeout Maximum amount of time for the inquiry before it is
	terminated. The timeout is specified as defined in the HCI section of the
	Bluetooth specification.  The time the inquiry is performed for is in fact
	timeout * 1.28 seconds. The allowed values of timeout are in the range 0x01
	to 0x30. This corresponds to an inquiry timeout range of 1.28 to 61.44
	seconds.
	
	@param class_of_device Class of device filter. Set to zero to be notified
	of all devices within range regardless of their class of device. If the
	class_of_device is set only devices with those bits set in their class of
	device will be reported to the client task. This filter can be made as
	specific or as general as necessary. For example, to discover all devices
	with major device class set to audio/ video set the class of device field
	to 0x400. This will result in devices with, for example, class of device
	set to 0x200404 and 0x200408 to be reported.  If, however, we want to limit
	our device search even further and only discover devices with their class
	of device set to headset, for example, the class_of_device field should be
	set to 0x200404. Please note that the filter reports devices that have a
	minimum of the specified bits set, however it is possible that a device
	also has other bits set in its class of device field. In that case that
	device will be reported back to the client task.
		
	This function initiates a Bluetooth inquiry to locate Bluetooth devices
	currently in range and discoverable. It allows a class of device filter to
	be specified so only devices with a specific class of device are reported
	back to the client task.

	Inquiry results are sent to the task specified in the theAppTask parameter
	by sending a CL_DM_INQUIRE_RESULT message with its status set to indicate
	that the message contains a valid result. Once the inquiry process
